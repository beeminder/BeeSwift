## 5.6.4 (June 9, 2020)
 - Bug fix (for real this time): the intermittent blank white screen is, we believe, vanquished for good.
 - Bug fix: for entering datapoints > 1000 (i.e., with a comma in US-style notation), the app no longer switches said comma to a decimal point
 - Bug fix: if you delete a datapoint, the datapoint now immediately disappears from the list of datapoints under the graph
 - Bug fix: similarly, if you edit a datapoint, the datapoint under the graph is now immediately updated. Furthermore, the value in the data entry field changes to reflect the edit.
 - Improvement: if a background fetch fails, there is no longer an alert ("Error fetching goals") waiting for you when you return to the app.
 - Improvement: we now prompt you to turn on notifications when switching to a new device or on a reinstall of the app, if necessary.

## 5.6.3 (May 6, 2020)
 - Bug fix: for the intermittent blank screen on loading

## 5.6.2 (Apr 23, 2020)
 - Time zone now displayed in Settings
 - The information about the minimum requirements each day is now under the graph.
 - Bug fix: when you entered invalid credentials, you previously were bombarded with multiple popups telling you that they were invalid, over and over. Now you just get one, which seems sufficient.
 - Bug fix, introduced briefly in 5.6: the sort feature was broken, now it's fixed.
 - Bug fix, introduced briefly in 5.6.1: the most recent datapoint was not showing underneath the graph
 - Search bar results are now preserved after you view an individual goal and return to the gallery screen

## 5.6.1 (Apr 22, 2020)
