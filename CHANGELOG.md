## 5.6.4 (June 9, 2020)

 - Bug fix: similarly, if you edit a datapoint, the datapoint under the graph is now immediately updated. Furthermore, the value in the data entry field changes to reflect the edit.
 - Improvement: if a background fetch fails, there is no longer an alert ("Error fetching goals") waiting for you when you return to the app.
 - Improvement: we now prompt you to turn on notifications when switching to a new device or on a reinstall of the app, if necessary.

 - Time zone now displayed in Settings
